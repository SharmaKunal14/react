What is async and defer?
-> In async, the script is fetched from the internet and executed as soon as the fetching is completed. THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ORDER IN WHICH THE SCRIPTS WILL BE EXECUTED!

Suppose that there are multiple scripts that are dependent on one another, in that case we should use defer.
In a nutshell, when we have independent scripts, we can use async, else defer.
