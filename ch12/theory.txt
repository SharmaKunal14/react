# useContext vs Redux.
-> useContext is a global state management tool developed by the React which is beneficial while developing small scale applications.
Redux is a global state management javascript library but it is mainly used in large scale applications. It is based on three main things -> Actions, Dispatcher and Reducer.

# Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux.
-> Redux Toolkit is easier to setup over Redux thus it speeds up the development process

# Explain Dispatcher.
-> Dispatcher is something that dispatches a particular action that leads to a change in state of the application. It

# Explain Reducer.
-> Reducer is nothing but a normal javascript function that modifies the state of our app on the commencement of an action as dispatched by the dispatcher.

# Explain slice.
-> Slice is just a piece the whole redux object which acts as a logical seperator for our whole store.

# Explain selector.
-> At the end of the day, Selector is just a hook and a hook is a normal javascript function. It is used to basically access the whole store/slice.

# Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.
-> createSlice takes in => 
1. name - the name of the slice.
2. initialState - the initial state of the slice.
3. reducers - the functions that will modify this particular slice of the state.
It returns an object on which we have <returnedObject>.actions, which includes all the actions that we have defined, along with <returnedObject>.reducer, that contains all the reducers as we have defined in the reducers property of the createSlice.
